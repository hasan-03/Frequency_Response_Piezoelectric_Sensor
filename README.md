# Frequency_Response_Piezoelectric_Sensor

This repository contains the IEEE report detailing the study of a piezoelectric sensor's working principle through frequency modulation of the input signal in the form of sound waves from a speacker and subsequent observation of its response. Through this experiment we identified the resonance and sub resonance frequences of the particular sensor.

The experiment was performed under the Guidance Dr. Arup Lal Chakraborty, Professor, IIT Gandhinagar and Ms. Maitrayee Phukan, Teaching Assistant, IIT Gandhinagar
